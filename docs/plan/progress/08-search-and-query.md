# 08 progress — Structured search, filters, and query performance

Plan: [Detailed checklist](../modules/08-search-and-query.md)  
Master: [Overall progress](../PROGRESS.md)  
Required protocol: [Execution and handoff rules](../EXECUTION.md)

## Current status

- Status: Not started
- Delivery scope: MVP backend
- Prerequisites: 07 complete; event contracts from 02, async dispatch completed in 09.
- Implementation started: No.
- Completed implementation checklist IDs: None.
- Active/next checklist group: 08.1, after prerequisites are satisfied.
- Last updated: 2026-09-17.
- Blocking issues discovered: None during planning; prerequisite completion is still required.
- Evidence: Planning documents only; no implementation or runtime validation yet.

## Step tracking

| Step | Purpose | State | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 08.1 | Define public query semantics | Not started | None yet |
| 08.2 | Implement database compilers and index lifecycle | Not started | None yet |

The linked module plan owns the detailed checkboxes. Update this table as work proceeds and link test reports/decisions rather than duplicating the whole checklist.

## Next actions

1. Read the latest master and dependency progress records and verify prerequisites.
2. Start the first unfinished item in 08.1.
3. Record the actual files changed, checks run, decisions, and next-session cautions here.

## Next-session cautions

Search must apply current authorization even while its index is stale. Do not expose raw FTS5 MATCH or PostgreSQL tsquery syntax as the public contract.

Do not infer completed implementation from this initialized record. Inspect the current repository and prior session entries before continuing.

## Session log

Every session affecting this module MUST append an entry following the [required template](../EXECUTION.md#required-session-entry-template), including progress, a change summary, verification, next actions, and next-session cautions. This includes planning, investigation, failed attempts, and documentation-only work.

### 2026-09-17 — Plan initialization

- Scope and checklist IDs: Defined module 08; no implementation checklist items executed.
- Progress: Created the detailed module plan and this paired progress record.
- Change summary: Established ordered work, dependencies, acceptance evidence, and continuity requirements for structured search, filters, and query performance.
- Files/artifacts: `docs/plan/modules/08-search-and-query.md`; `docs/plan/progress/08-search-and-query.md`.
- Verification: Reviewed planning scope against the initial architecture and cross-module boundaries. Package-wide documentation checks are recorded in master progress; application/runtime tests were not run because this session only created plans.
- Decisions and deviations: Follow the source reconciliations in [SOURCES](../SOURCES.md). No new implementation deviation approved.
- Blockers/open questions: None resolved by implementation; close the module's design/compatibility decisions during its ordered steps.
- Next actions: Complete prerequisites, then begin 08.1.
- Next-session cautions: Search must apply current authorization even while its index is stale. Do not expose raw FTS5 MATCH or PostgreSQL tsquery syntax as the public contract.
